    "## Non-uniform Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "While the uniform distribution of the values produced by random() is useful for a lot of purposes, other distributions more accurately model specific situations. The random module includes functions to produce values in those distributions, too. They are listed here, but not covered in detail because their uses tend to be specialized and require more complex examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normal\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is commonly used for non-uniform continuous values such as grades, heights, weights, etc. The curve produced by the distribution has a distinctive shape which has lead to it being nicknamed a “bell curve.” random includes two functions for generating values with a normal distribution, normalvariate() and the slightly faster gauss() (the normal distribution is also called the Gaussian distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "The related function, lognormvariate() produces pseudorandom values where the logarithm of the values is distributed normally. Log-normal distributions are useful for values that are the product of several random variables which do not interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "The triangular distribution is used as an approximate distribution for small sample sizes. The “curve” of a triangular distribution has low points at known minimum and maximum values, and a high point at the mode, which is estimated based on a “most likely” outcome (reflected by the mode argument to triangular()).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponential\n",
    "\n",
    "expovariate() produces an exponential distribution useful for simulating arrival or interval time values for in homogeneous Poisson processes such as the rate of radioactive decay or requests coming into a web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pareto, or power law, distribution matches many observable phenomena and was popularized by The Long Tail, by Chris Anderson. The paretovariate() function is useful for simulating allocation of resources to individuals (wealth to people, demand for musicians, attention to blogs, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Angular\n",
    "\n",
    "The von Mises, or circular normal, distribution (produced by vonmisesvariate()) is used for computing probabilities of cyclic values such as angles, calendar days, and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "betavariate() generates values with the Beta distribution, which is commonly used in Bayesian statistics and applications such as task duration modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gamma distribution produced by gammavariate() is used for modeling the sizes of things such as waiting times, rainfall, and computational errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Weibull distribution computed by weibullvariate() is used in failure analysis, industrial engineering, and weather forecasting. It describes the distribution of sizes of particles or other discrete objects."
