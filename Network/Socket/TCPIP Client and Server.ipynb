    "Many servers have more than one network interface, and therefore more than one IP address. Rather than running separate copies of a service bound to each IP address, use the special address INADDR_ANY to listen on all addresses at the same time. Although socket defines a constant for INADDR_ANY, it is an integer value and must be converted to a dotted-notation string address before it can be passed to bind(). As a shortcut, use “0.0.0.0” or an empty string ('') instead of doing the conversion."
