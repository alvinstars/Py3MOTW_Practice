    "Creating temporary files with unique names securely, so they cannot be guessed by someone wanting to break the application or steal the data, is challenging. The tempfile module provides several functions for creating temporary file system resources securely. TemporaryFile() opens and returns an unnamed file, NamedTemporaryFile() opens and returns a named file, SpooledTemporaryFile holds its content in memory before writing to disk, and TemporaryDirectory is a context manager that removes the directory when the context is closed."

    "Applications that need temporary files to store data, without needing to share that file with other programs, should use the TemporaryFile() function to create the files. The function creates a file, and on platforms where it is possible, unlinks it immediately. This makes it impossible for another program to find or open the file, since there is no reference to it in the file system table. The file created by TemporaryFile() is removed automatically when it is closed, whether by calling close() or by using the context manager API and with statement.\n",
