    "\n",
    "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/252703/append-vs-extend\n",
    "\n",
    "* append \n",
    "\n",
    "adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list. The length of the list itself will increase by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* extend \n",
    "\n",
    "iterates over its argument adding each element to the list, extending the list. The length of the list will increase by however many elements were in the iterable argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operator Overload, __and__, (+) and __iand__ (+=)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both + and += operators are defined for list. They are semantically similar to extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list + another_list creates a third list in memory, so you can return the result of it, but it requires that the second iterable be a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list += another_list modifies the list in-place (it is the in-place operator, and lists are mutable objects, as we've seen) so it does not create a new list. It also works like extend, in that the second iterable can be any kind of iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Append has constant time complexity, O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend has time complexity, O(k).\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating through the multiple calls to append adds to the complexity, making it equivalent to that of extend, and since extend's iteration is implemented in C, it will always be faster if you intend to append successive items from an iterable onto a list\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that extend can run much faster than append, and it is semantically clearer, so it is preferred when you intend to append each element in an iterable to a list.\n",
